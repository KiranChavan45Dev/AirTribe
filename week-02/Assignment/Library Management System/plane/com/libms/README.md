# 📚 Library Management System (Java, Console-Based)

A console-based **Library Management System (LMS)** built in **Java 11** for demonstration of **OOP concepts, SOLID principles, and design patterns**.  
The system manages **books, patrons, branches, and lending operations** without requiring a database.

## ✨ Features

### Core
- **Book Management**
  - Add, remove, and search books (by title, author, ISBN).
  - Track borrowed and available books.
- **Patron Management**
  - Add and update patrons.
  - Track borrowing history.
- **Lending Process**
  - Book checkout and return.
  - Reservation system for unavailable books.
- **Inventory Management**
  - Branch-specific inventory handling.
  - Prevents duplicate checkouts.

### Extensions
- **Multi-Branch Support**
  - Create multiple branches.
  - View all branches.
- **Reservation**
  - Patrons can reserve books.
  - Notification placeholder for availability.
- **Recommendations**
  - Suggests books based on patron borrowing history (basic strategy).
- **Design Patterns**
  - **Factory Pattern** → for creating `Book` objects.
  - **Strategy / Observer (extendable)** → for recommendation and notification system.

## 🏗️ Design Principles & Patterns

- **OOP Concepts**
  - `Book`, `Patron`, `Branch`, `Inventory` → Encapsulation & Abstraction
  - `BookFactory`, `PatronFactory` → Polymorphism via Factory
- **SOLID**
  - **S**ingle Responsibility → Each class handles a single concern
  - **O**pen/Closed → Easily extendable for new features
  - **L**iskov Substitution → Interfaces (e.g., recommend strategies) interchangeable
  - **I**nterface Segregation → Lightweight services
  - **D**ependency Inversion → High-level modules don’t depend on low-level details
- **Design Patterns**
  - **Factory** → `BookFactory`, `PatronFactory`
  - **Observer (Publisher-Subscriber)** → `NotificationService` for reservations
  - **Strategy** → `RecommendationService` for recommendations

# Logging

## The project uses java.util.logging for:

- Successful operations (adding books, patrons, etc.)

- Warnings (duplicate ISBNs, unavailable books)

- Errors (invalid inputs)
